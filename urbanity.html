          <p class = "projectText">At <span class = "emphasizedWords">Two Tall Totems</span>, the very first steps in starting a new project is called the <span class = "emphasizedWords">"Discover Phase"</span> at which a meeting with some shareholders is called upon to gather as much information we need to successfully create an app. This involves <span class = "emphasizedWords">determining the goal of the product</span> and what kind of users it achieves to have and which problem it aims to solve.</p>


          <h3 class = "titleQs nextQs">MINDMAPPING</h3>
          <p class = "projectText">Using the software <span class = "emphasizedWords">MINDNODE</span>, we create mindmaps based on the information we have gathered with the client during the <span class = "emphasizedWords">discovery meetings</span>. These mindmaps help us determine what kind of <span class = "emphasizedWords">functionalities</span> and <span class = "emphasizedWords">features</span> the product would have. This will also speed up the process when creating the <span class = "emphasizedWords">user experience design</span> of the product by guiding the designer through the core functionalities and determine which features to keep or eliminate if needed.</p>

          <h3 class = "titleQs">WIREFRAMING</h3>
          <p class = "projectText">Using the industry-standard software, <span class = "emphasizedWords">SKETCH</span>, we proceed in creating <span class = "emphasizedWords">low fidelity wireframes</span> with every aspect and screens of the app. This includes <span class = "emphasizedWords">empty states or idle states</span> for each core features to ensure that the client and developers, in addition to the designers, <span class = "emphasizedWords">understand the flow and customer journey</span> while using the application. This also ensures that all features complement each other and that every interaction makes sense for every users no matter what kind of device (iOS or Android) they are using. </p>


          <h3 class = "titleQs nextQs">MY ROLE</h3>
          <p class = "projectText">As a UX/UI Designer at Two Tall Totems, I was proud to takeover as the main designer for this project. I was given the very early wireframes and prototypes from the very first discovery session a few months prior before the start of my workterm. From these resources, I was able to <span class = "emphasizedWords">refine the UX design</span> of the app by <span class = "emphasizedWords">eliminating conflicting interactions</span> such as combining the preferred delivery method and choice of payment method.</p>

        <div class = "grid3of5">
          <h3 class = "titleQs">MY ROLE</h3>
          <p class = "projectText">For the onboarding part of Urbanity, I <span class = "emphasizedWords">created the icons</span> that complements the onboarding statements. These icons are created using the <span class = "emphasizedWords">app's branding</span> while keeping in mind that the user's attention will be focusing on these graphics mostly rather than the text. For this case, the icons have to simple enough yet they have to convey the most information that basically summarizes the content of the particular onboarding screen. This <span class = "emphasizedWords">flow</span> also demonstrates the implementation of social media login buttons that <span class = "emphasizedWords">comply with Google and Facebook's standards</span>.</p>
          <h3 class = "titleQs">IMAGINING DIFFERENT SCENARIOS (Buyer vs Seller Screens)</h3>
          <p class = "projectText">Since the application will be aimed towards <span class = "emphasizedWords">two major types of users</span>, a buyer and a seller, I had to think about the two scenarios while designing the user interface. One example is the Chat function, which answers the question: <span class = "emphasizedWords">What will User A see when User B does this action?</span>
          <br/>
          Since this is a <span class = "emphasizedWords">buy &amp; sell app</span>, designing the user interface had to consider <span class = "emphasizedWords">both types of users</span>. This will <span class = "emphasizedWords">eliminate future problems</span> such as conflicting features and interactions. This will also make it easier to present the design to the client as it will allow for more understanding of the user flow in the app. Ultimately, imagining all the different scenarios allowed the developers to create the application with ease without having to ask the designer for additional questions during the development phase.</p>

        <div class = "grid3of5">
          <p class = "projectText">During the <span class = "emphasizedWords">four months</span> I worked as a UX/UI Designer at Two Tall Totems, I have gained a lot of skills that I would be able to utilize moving forward my career path while improving on some of the skills I already have.
          <br/><br/>
          I was able to learn the different tips and tricks <span class = "emphasizedWords">SKETCH</span> has to offer which ultimately <span class = "emphasizedWords">improved my design process and workflow</span>. Using this software has made me realize that there are far more superior, if not the same, softwares than Adobe Creative Suite in creating engaging, interactive, and useful designs.
          <br/><br/>
          I was able to <span class = "emphasizedWords">experience real-world</span>, client-facing scenarios in creating a product from <span class = "emphasizedWords">scratch</span>. This allowed to have an experience in presenting my designs to prospective clients, and at the same time, <span class = "emphasizedWords">improved my communication skills</span> because I had to present in a way that is concise and simple while making sure the client and developers understand every aspect of my designs.
          <br/><br/>
          Finally, Two Tall Totems has made me <span class = "emphasizedWords">realize</span> that being a UX/UI Designer is the right path for me. With an increadible, helpful, and knowledgeable team, I was able to mature as student designer and has cemented the right path for me moving forward. It has been an incredible four-month ride and I couldn't ask for a better way to spend my FALL 2017.</p>
